            <p>
                FYI!!!!! Our website is called MUSIC cause it got music in it. 
                Since spotify banished all free apk mods and all pirate shit (besides <a href="https://spicetify.app/">spicetify</a>ðŸ‘€... ) 
                we've decided to create our own shit. 
                Our website is not fully finished yet, but so far we've got eneugh music for everybody to listen. 
                But really though these are just my favorite albums that im happy to share.

                                    <h1>Also this website is not finished.</h1>
